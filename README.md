# Elements
Cloud Elements has created a community of customer made elements that can be viewed, downloaded, and shared. This is an independent catalog of abstract elements created by customers, partners and Cloud Elements developers. Additionally, this community supports our partners leveraging CloudElements technology such as SAP Open Connectors and Axway iPaaS.

Check out a simple [example](https://github.com/CloudElementsOpenLabs/examples/tree/master/elements) of an element if you are unsure of how to get started

### Using
To begin using any of the previously created elements within this repo, clone the repo to your own repo and begin implementing the element to work with your environment.

### Contributing
To contribute we ask that you create a folder that contains the Element JSON as well as a short README file with a description of what you built (endpoint name and resources available so people can see them without importing the Element), a link to the documentation you used when creating the Element, and any known endpoint limitation that might affect how your Element works.

Review the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/CloudElementsOpenLabs/elements/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. 

If this is the first Element that you are building or sharing Please see our [Element Builder Documentation](https://docs.cloud-elements.com/home/element-builder-overview).

### Disclaimer
Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CloudElementsOpenLabs/elements/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before using the provided elements.
These elements have been created for or by customers and are not maintained or updated by Cloud Elements. Therefore, these elements should be used at your own risk, and are not recommended in production environments.  Community Elements may lack unification features such as Auth, Eventing and Bulk.  Additionally, the elements provided in this community are used privately within your own Element Catalog.  The public Cloud Elements catalog of pre-built API integrations can be found on our [website](https://cloud-elements.com/elements-catalog/).
